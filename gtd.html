<h2>My (simple) implementation of Getting Things Done</h2>
<h3>Inbox</h3>
<p>Implemented as a Trello board, <strong>Basket</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Lists</em> on the board correspond to various categories of work - <strong>Reading</strong>, <strong>Personal</strong>, <strong>School</strong> and <strong>NUS Hackers</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Cards</em> correspond to action items. Some tasks contain checklists, some have due dates.</p>
<p>New items get added as cards into the appropriate list. Every day, daily objectives get moved into the <strong>Today</strong> board.</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Contains 3 lists - <strong>To Do</strong>, <strong>Doing</strong> &amp; <strong>Done</strong>.</p>
<p>The cards to be processed each day get moved into the <em>To Do</em> list. They then move to <em>Doing</em> and <em>Done</em>. At the end of the day, all cards in <em>Done</em> get archived and stuff in <em>To Do</em> and <em>Doing</em> is moved back into the <strong>Basket</strong>. The objective is to have all of the day's cards end up in <em>Done</em> by the end of the day. Adjust daily objectives by measured output (and increase gradually).</p>
<h3>Long Term</h3>
<p>A number of tasks are very low-priority and possibly optional. These get added into the <strong>Long Term</strong> board.</p>
<p>The <em>lists</em> in this board are: <strong>Thoughts/Writing</strong>, <strong>Reading</strong>, <strong>Watching/Listening</strong> and <strong>Hacking</strong>. New lists may be added as required.</p>
<p>Sometimes, tasks from <strong>Basket</strong> get moved to this board.</p>
<p>This board is reviewed every once in a while (at least weekly), and tasks that no longer seem relevant, useful or interesting are archived. Tasks from this board are not currently done on a regular basis, but this needs to be changed. Ideally, at least one task from this should be moved into the <strong>Basket</strong> and done every week.</p>
