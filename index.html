        <p>This page is woefully outdated. It describes who I <em>was</em>, not who I <em>am</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ship_of_Theseus&oldid=717778703">Or... hmm... it's all kinda confusing</a>.</p>

      <h3>Hi, I'm Pallav</h3>

      <p>I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I like trying my hand at different things. I have an active interest in computer science research. I also enjoy reading very random stuff, competitive programming and jumping out of (metaphorical) windows.</p>

      <h3>What I do</h3>

      <p>I'm doing my last semester in school right now, spending most of my time reading papers, watching TV shows and pretending to study (with questionable prioritization). I'm also working on my Final Year Project with the <a href="http://adacomp.comp.nus.edu.sg/">Adaptive Computing Labs</a> on improving <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5189-despot-online-pomdp-planning-with-regularization">an online POMDP solver</a>. As part of <a href="http://nushackers.org/">NUS Hackers</a>, I've run workshops, been in charge of Hack&Roll 2015 (then Singapore's biggest student-run hackathon) and was previously responsible for setting up and managing the first student-run hackerspace in Singapore.</p>

      <p>I did an internship as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Engineering">Facebook</a> this summer. I worked on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/wormhole-pubsub-system-moving-data-through-space-and-time/10151504075843920">Wormhole</a> team and spent the summer building configuration synchronization services, code generators and a web UI. I enjoyed picking up C++11 constructs, working on synchronization code spanning a whole bunch of services and learning <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>

      <p>I spent most of 2014 doing an internship on the <a href="https://www.palantir.com/solutions/healthcare-delivery/">Health</a> <a href="https://www.palantir.com/solutions/pharma/">team</a> at Palantir Technologies. I worked on homogenizing large, heterogenous, semi-structured datasets and building fast data analysis tools on top of them. The most fun parts were learning R in a day and hacking up my own plugins for ElasticSearch. (The latter helped reduce the time taken for some super-complicated queries at a pharmaceutical research lab from a few days to about a second.)

      <p>Before this, I worked as a research assistant at NUS, adding sensors to an <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">AR Drone 2.0</a> and trying to make it fly on its own. I've also worked at the <a href="http://www.idmi.nus.edu.sg/">Interactive and Digital Media Institute</a> on a <a href="http://github.com/lonce/jsaSound">web-based audio platform</a> and <a href="http://github.com/pshinghal/jsaBard">a way to tell stories with sound</a>.

      <p>My <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/pshinghal#profile-projects">past projects</a> include Hush, Ospy, <a href="http://www.ayulin.net/isaac">ISAAC</a> and some other random stuff.</p>

      <h3>Drop me a note</h3>

      <p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/pshinghal">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com/pshinghal">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/pshinghal">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
