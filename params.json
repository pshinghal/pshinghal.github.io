{"name":"pshinghal","tagline":"","body":"### Hi, I'm Pallav\r\n\r\nI'm an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore. I like trying my hand at different things. I have an active interest in computer science research, particularly in the field of Planning Under Uncertainty. I also enjoy reading very random stuff, competitive programming and jumping out of (metaphorical) windows.\r\n\r\n### What I do\r\n\r\nI'm currently working as a research assistant at NUS, trying to achieve reliable autonomous navigation in unknown environments with an [AR Drone 2.0](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/). I've also been working with @lonce and @srikumarks at the [Interactive and Digital Media Institute](http://www.idmi.nus.edu.sg/) on a few projects related to web-based audio platforms, particularly their application in storytelling ([jsaSound](http://github.com/lonce/jsaSound) and [jsaBard](http://github.com/pshinghal/jsaBard)).\r\n\r\nPreviously, I've also worked on [Hush](http://hush.sh), [Ospy](http://ospy.me), [ISAAC](http://www.ayulin.net/isaac) and some other random stuff.\r\n\r\n### Drop me a note\r\n\r\nYou can find me on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/pshinghal) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/pshinghal).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
